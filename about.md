title: About
---

I'm Michael Lo, a [Master's student](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) of the [College of Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I currently work as a freelance security researcher, earning bug bounties and disclosing zero-day vulnerabilities.

I like participating in Capture-the-Flag competitions (CTFs) and am open to joining a team :). I specialize in binary exploitation (pwn) and reverse engineering (rev).

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, games, sports, and time with my family and church.

Online, I go by "10g0s".
